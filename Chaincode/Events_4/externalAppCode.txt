Now, let's consider an external application or component that
wants to listen for the "AssetCreated" event and respond to it.

// Lets say this function is created in another language
// Listen for the "AssetCreated" event
func ListenForAssetCreatedEvent() {
    // Connect to the blockchain network
    // Subscribe to the "AssetCreated" event
    // Specify a callback function to handle event notifications
    blockchainClient.SubscribeToEvent("AssetCreated", func(eventPayload []byte) {
        // Process the event payload (e.g., extract the asset ID)
        assetID := string(eventPayload)

        // Perform actions based on the event (e.g., update UI, trigger processes)
        fmt.Printf("New asset created with ID: %s\n", assetID)
    })
}


Event Notification:

When a new asset is created using the chaincode's CreateAsset function,
the chaincode emits an "AssetCreated" event with the asset ID as the payload. 
This event notification is broadcasted to all registered listeners.


Handling Events:

The external application, which is listening for "AssetCreated" events, 
receives the event notification and triggers the specified callback function. 
In this example, the callback function simply prints the asset ID to the console, 
but in a real-world scenario, it could perform more meaningful actions such as 
updating a user interface, triggering business processes, or integrating with other systems.
